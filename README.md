## What is this about?
This repository is entirely dedicated to the creation and utilization of tools designed to enhance game programming and development through artificial intelligence. It serves as a comprehensive resource for developers looking to integrate AI-driven solutions into their workflows, offering innovative methodologies, frameworks, and utilities to streamline and optimize the game development process.

## Why?
I have always been interested in video games; I consider their creation to be an art form, capable of conveying a wide range of emotions, sensations, and stories. I constantly think about creative concepts and ideas for new games, but I have always faced a major barrier: not knowing how to program. Due to my academic background in business administration, I haven't had the time to deeply learn programming languages, let alone develop a video game from scratch.

However, in my eighth semester, I took a class that completely changed my perspective. During the course, we analyzed multiple AI-powered tools, which led me to the idea of creating video games with their support. That’s how, with almost no programming knowledge, I developed my first video game.

For this reason, I have decided that it would be amazing if anyone could create great games and bring their ideas to life without having to spend years on development. I don’t want programmers to disappear; I want game development to become accessible to everyone.
