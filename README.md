## What is this about?
This repository is entirely dedicated to the creation and utilization of tools designed to enhance game programming and development through artificial intelligence. It serves as a comprehensive resource for developers looking to integrate AI-driven solutions into their workflows, offering innovative methodologies, frameworks, and utilities to streamline and optimize the game development process.

## Why?
I have always been interested in video games; I consider their creation to be an art form, capable of conveying a wide range of emotions, sensations, and stories. I constantly think about creative concepts and ideas for new games, but I have always faced a major barrier: not knowing how to program. Due to my academic background in business administration, I haven't had the time to deeply learn programming languages, let alone develop a video game from scratch.

However, in my eighth semester, I took a class that completely changed my perspective. During the course, we analyzed multiple AI-powered tools, which led me to the idea of creating video games with their support. That’s how, with almost no programming knowledge, I developed my first video game.

For this reason, I have decided that it would be amazing if anyone could create great games and bring their ideas to life without having to spend years on development. I don’t want programmers to disappear; I want game development to become accessible to everyone.

## The Name?
The name, while amusing to me, might be considered vulgar from other people's perspectives. However, it has a deeply personal origin for me as the creator of this repository.

During my seventh semester in Business Administration, I had to develop a project based on the IKIGAI methodology. In other words, I needed to come up with an idea that I loved, was good at, was needed by others, and could earn me money. As part of this exercise, I thought of creating a video game—or at least starting its development.

However, as you may have read before, my programming skills are practically nonexistent. Because of this, I decided to team up with three friends from high school who are studying fields related to video game development, such as Graphic Design and Programming. To this day, the game is still in the conceptualization phase, and we continue refining the story and gameplay mechanics. I hope that one day we’ll be able to release it.

As we worked on the idea, we realized that once we published the game, we would need a name for the developer studio. That’s when we came up with the idea of naming it after our Discord chat: "Astrodildos". This name is simply a play on words inspired by the first multiplayer game we played together: "Astro Droids."

With this background in mind, I chose this name for the repository because my goal here is to bring people together around a shared passion: video games. Just as the Astrodildos group helped strengthen our friendship, I want this space to connect others with the same passion.
